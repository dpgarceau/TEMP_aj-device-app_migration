# fetch_update.sh - AeroJudge Update Fetcher
# =============================================================================
# This script is installed on the device and fetches/executes the latest
# update script from GitHub. This allows the main update logic to be
# updated remotely without needing to modify files on individual devices.
#
# Usage:
#   /home/judge/fetch_update.sh                  # Legacy: full update (download + install)
#   /home/judge/fetch_update.sh --download-only  # Phase 1: check + download assets
#   /home/judge/fetch_update.sh --install        # Phase 2: backup, install, health check
#
# Exit Codes (passed through from judge_update.sh):
#   0 = No update needed (already running latest version)
#   1 = Error occurred during update
#   2 = Update successfully applied / assets downloaded and ready
